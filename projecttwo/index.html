 <h1> I'm Kilana and I’m an editor. Let me tell you I’m as unique as my name.</h1>  
<p> My friends describe me as a penguin. You can make up your own conclusions, but I’m fluffy, cute, and I tend to fall over. </p> 

<p> Just to clarify, I’m  “fluffy” personality wise. I’m not actually hairy. </p>

<p> I’m just an all around positive person and my goal is to spread that positivity to as many people as I can. My outlook on life is different than a lot of people. This may be because of my ADHD induced brain, or it could be that the past few years have given me WAY too much to think about. Before 2015, I thought I had everything figured out about this world. I thought I knew exactly where I wanted life to take me. After going away to school, I realized...I WAS WRONG. Growing up in suburban New Jersey teaches you absolutely nothing.</p>

<p> My hobby started early when I used to make powerpoints of my favorite things. And when I finally transitioned to making photo collages with Windows Movie Maker my love for making videos was solidified. I actually didn't know I wanted to be an editor until after watching a behind the scenes video of Friends. The way they put together the episode was so meticulous that it just called out to me. I’m a meticulous person if you couldn't already have guessed.</p> 

<p> I see editing as a puzzle and it’s up to me to put it together the way I want. </p>
